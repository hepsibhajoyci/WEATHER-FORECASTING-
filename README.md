# WEATHER-FORECASTING-
The Weather Forecast application is developed using Python to display current weather information of a selected location. It fetches real-time weather data such as temperature,  wind speed, and weather conditions using a weather API. This project helps users understand how to work with APIs, handle JSON data, and use Python libraries like requests.
